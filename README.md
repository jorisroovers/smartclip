# Smartclip #

Smart clipboard app for macOS written in NodeJS using electron. Focus on developer and power-user convenience.

I have some good ideas, but it's very early stages at this point! Using this opportunity to learn ReactJS along the way :-)

# TODO #
- Storing clips in encrypted file
    - Generate encryption key on first install (this is for later)
- image resizing and cropping from tray
- autoformat json, yaml, etc
- convert from json to e.g. yaml
- trim whitespace
- base64, md5, encode, etc
